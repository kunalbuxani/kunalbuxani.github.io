        <p>Rhyolite is a Gold Rush town in Nevada, just east of Death Valley NP. It was founded after a couple of
            dudes found gold in 1904, with the population reaching a peak of about 8000. By 1920,
            the ore had been depleted, leaving the town deserted but for 14 people. All that remains 
            of the old town is the husks of a few buildings. In the 1980s an open-air sculpture was erected, depicting
            The Last Supper against the dramatic backdrop of the Amargosa Valley. Other artworks followed. 
            One's a giant Lego-like thing of a naked woman.</p>
